# **Business Understanding**
## Introduction

## Problem statement
To develop models for an insurance company using the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease, which would help the insurance company estimate health risks and adjust premiums accordingly.


\newpage

# **Data Understanding**
The dataset contains various features related to patients' health and demographic information. We will explore the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.

## Data description
The Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains 303 instances and 14 attributes. These attributes include both numerical and categorical variables related to patients' health metrics and demographic information. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. These attributes are:

1. `age`: Age of the patient (numeric)
2. `sex`: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
3. `cp`: Chest pain type (categorical: 1-4)
4. `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (numeric)
5. `chol`: Serum cholesterol (numeric)
6. `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar (1 = true, 0 = false)
7. `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (categorical)
8. `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved (numeric)
9. `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
10. `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise (numeric)
11. `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (categorical)
12. `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3, numeric)
13. `thal`: Thalassemia (categorical: 1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
14. `target`: Heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

## Data dictionary

## Initial observations
* The dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical variables.
* Some variables may require preprocessing, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
* Missing Values: Some fields like ca and thal may have missing values or unknown entries (‘?’).
* Data Types: Some categorical variables are encoded numerically and will need to be interpreted correctly during analysis.
* Class Imbalance: Preliminary checks suggest the dataset is relatively balanced between presence and absence of disease, but this will be verified.
* Outliers: Numerical fields such as chol (cholesterol) and trestbps (blood pressure) may have outliers that need to be detected and considered in analysis.

```

## Data preprocessing
We will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**Convert binary variables to (0, 1)**

According to the data dictionary, the following attributes should be binary variables: `sex`, `fbs`, `exang`, and `target`. But, some shows to have values besides 0’s and 1’s.
Let’s convert binary variables to (0, 1)
```{r}
Heart.df$target <- ifelse(Heart.df$target > 0, 1, 0)
Heart.df$sex <- ifelse(Heart.df$sex > 0, 1, 0)
Heart.df$fbs <- ifelse(Heart.df$fbs > 0, 1, 0)
Heart.df$exang <- ifelse(Heart.df$exang > 0, 1, 0)
```

**Handle missing values**

Handle missing values in `ca` and `thal` variables using mean/mode imputation.
```{r}
Heart.df$ca[is.na(Heart.df$ca)] <- median(Heart.df$ca, na.rm = TRUE)
Heart.df$ca[Heart.df$ca == "?"] <- median(Heart.df$ca, na.rm = TRUE)
Heart.df$thal[is.na(Heart.df$thal)] <- median(Heart.df$thal, na.rm = TRUE)
Heart.df$ca[Heart.df$thal == "?"] <- median(Heart.df$thal, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Check for missing values if still exist
```{r}
sapply(Heart.df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

**Handle duplicate entries**

Check for duplicate entries and print them if they exist.
```{r}
dupes <- Heart.df[duplicated(Heart.df) | duplicated(Heart.df, fromLast = TRUE), ]
print(dupes)
```

**Convert categorical variables to factor.**

Define a list of categorical columns with their levels and labels
```{r}
categorical_columns <- list(
  sex = list(levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Female", "Male")),
  cp = list(levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4), labels = c("Typical Angina", 
                                               "Atypical Angina", "Non-Angina",
                                               "Asymptomatic")),
  fbs = list(levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("False", "True")),
  restecg = list(levels = c(0, 1, 2), labels = c("Normal", "Wave-abnormality", "Probable")),
  exang = list(levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
  slope = list(levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("Upsloping", "Flat", 
                                               "Downsloping")),
  thal = list(levels = c(3, 6, 7), labels = c("Normal", "Fixed Defect", "Reversible")),
  target = list(levels = c(1, 0), labels = c("Yes", "No"))
)
```

Apply the factor transformation using a for-loop.
```{r}
for (col in names(categorical_columns)) {
  Heart.df[[col]] <- factor(Heart.df[[col]], 
                            levels = categorical_columns[[col]]$levels, 
                            labels = categorical_columns[[col]]$labels)
}
```

**Handle outliers in numerical variables**

Apply multiple filters to identify and handle outliers in numerical variables.
```{r}
Heart.df <- Heart.df[Heart.df$age > 40 &
                       Heart.df$trestbps < 170 &
                       Heart.df$chol < 340 &
                       Heart.df$chol > 150 &
                       Heart.df$thalach > 115 &
                       Heart.df$oldpeak < 2.4, ]
```
This section of the analysis performs a crucial data-cleaning step aimed at refining the quality of the dataset before modeling and visualization. The filtering operation applies a set of logical conditions to remove extreme or biologically implausible values from key continuous health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and ST depression. By doing so, it ensures that the dataset reflects realistic patient characteristics and minimizes the influence of outliers that could distort statistical interpretation or predictive accuracy.

The first filter, `Heart.df\$age > 40`, narrows the focus to patients over 40 years of age. This decision is grounded in clinical reasoning—heart disease is relatively uncommon in younger individuals, and including them could introduce noise rather than insight into cardiovascular risk patterns. The next condition, `Heart.df$trestbps < 170`, restricts resting blood pressure to physiologically typical values, removing excessively high readings that may result from measurement error or rare hypertensive crises.

Similarly, cholesterol values are filtered using two constraints: `Heart.df$chol < 340` and `Heart.df\$chol > 150`. This dual boundary ensures that cholesterol readings fall within a realistic clinical range, excluding both unusually low and excessively high values. Extremely high cholesterol levels (above 340 mg/dl) could be outliers due to lab errors or rare genetic conditions, while very low levels (below 150 mg/dl) are equally atypical for this patient population.

The condition `Heart.df\$thalach > 115` retains only those patients whose maximum heart rate achieved during exercise falls within a normal performance range. Extremely low thalach values often suggest incomplete stress tests or data entry errors, which could bias the interpretation of cardiovascular efficiency. Finally, `Heart.df$oldpeak < 2.4` removes extreme ST depression values. In clinical terms, oldpeak measures the degree of ST segment depression during exercise, and values beyond 2.4 are uncommon and may represent atypical cardiac events that do not align with general population patterns in the dataset.

Overall, these filters collectively enhance the integrity of the data and the reliability of subsequent analysis. By trimming implausible extremes, the dataset becomes more homogeneous, improving the clarity of boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots generated during exploratory data analysis. Moreover, this targeted filtering supports more stable and interpretable model outcomes by preventing a few extreme observations from disproportionately influencing trends or coefficients. The result is a dataset that better represents realistic health profiles, ultimately strengthening the credibility of insights drawn from the heart disease risk modeling process.

## Exploratory data analysis
### Boxplots for numerical variables
I used boxplots to visually examine the distribution of key continuous health indicators — such as age, resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), maximum heart rate (thalach), and ST depression (oldpeak) — across the binary target variable (Heart Disease: Yes / No).
Boxplots were chosen because they efficiently highlight differences in central tendency (median), variability (IQR), and the presence of potential outliers between patients with and without heart disease.

**Boxplot of Age by Heart Disease**
```{r}
HeartDiseaseBoxplot("target", "age")
```


**Boxplot of Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps) by Heart Disease**
